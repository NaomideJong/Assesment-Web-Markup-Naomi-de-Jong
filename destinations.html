        <header>Barracuda Point, Sipadan Island, Malaysia</header>
        <p>
          Wall of coral where sharks come cruising by and barracuda surround
          you. You are guaranteed to see big stuff here and lots of it.
          Occasional strong currents blast over an underwater prairie that's
          home to white tips, turtles, grouper, jacks, bumphead parrotfish and
          of course the barracuda that give it its name. For those who want to
          be surrounded by some of the most fascinating ocean life the world has
          to offer, Barracuda Point just off Sipadan Island is certainly one of
          the best places to go.

        <header>Micronesia, Palau, Blue Corner Wall</header>
        <p>
          An upwelling means this splendid wall sectione is favoured by
          pelagics. Expect to see sharks, barracuda, eagle rays, Napoleon
          wrasse, snappers, jacks...if you can tear your eyes away from the fish
          the wall hosts thick coral with morays, nudibranchs and mantis shrimps
          being just a few of the attractions. Once hooked in look up and view
          the main attraction out over the reef wall, you will see the different
          shark species and snappers gliding by in the current. Eventually,
          unhook and glide over the reef spotting sleeping sharks and beautiful
          coral formations.

        <header>Australia, The Yongala</header>
        <p>
          The Yongala is a shipwreck off the coast of Queensland. Full of marine
          life you may see manta rays, sea snakes, octopuses, turtles, bull
          sharks, tiger sharks, clouds of fish and spectacular coral. The
          Yongala sank during a cyclone in 1911 killing 122 people, a racehorse
          called Moonshine and a red Lincolnshire bull. In 1981 the Yongala was
          given official protection under the Historic Shipwrecks Act. The ship
          is 90 km southeast of Townsville, 10 km away form Cape Bowling Green.
          109 meters long, the bow points north and the ship lists to starboard.

        <header>Thistlegorm, Egyptian Red Sea</header>
        <p>
          A large wreck which needs several dives to do it justice. A British
          vessel, the Thistlegorm (Blue Thistle) was attacked from the air and
          sunk in 1941 whilst carrying a cargo of war supplies: rifles, motor
          bikes, train carriages, trucks. The Red Sea also has extensive shallow
          shelves, noted for their marine life and corals. The sea is the
          habitat of over 1,000 invertebrate species and 200 types of soft and
          hard coral. It is the world's northernmost tropical sea, and has been
          designated a Global 200 ecoregion.

        <header>Shark and Yolanda Reef, Egyptian Red Sea</header>
        <p>
          Three dives in one: anemone city, shark reef with its spectacular drop
          off and the wreck of the Yolanda. Currents make this good for drift
          dives and for pelagic fish. A popular dive starts at Anemone City
          before drifting to Shark Reef and its drop off. The Red Sea also has
          extensive shallow shelves, noted for their marine life and corals. The
          sea is the habitat of over 1,000 invertebrate species and 200 types of
          soft and hard coral. It is the world's northernmost tropical sea, and
          has been designated a Global 200 ecoregion.

        <header>Manta Ray Night Dive, Kailua Kona, Hawaii</header>
        <p>
          “The Kona manta rays were amazing at night and they swim right
          underneath you.” Underwater lights placed on the ocean floor attract
          infinite amounts of plankton, which in turn attract the huge, yet
          beautiful manta rays of Kona Hawaii. The rays get so close to you,
          that you often have to move to avoid them accidentally hitting you. An
          amazingly wonderful and unforgettable time with one of the most
          beautiful animals in the world.
