            <p>
              Wall of coral where sharks come cruising by and barracuda surround
              you. You are guaranteed to see big stuff here and lots of it.
              Occasional strong currents blast over an underwater prairie that's
              home to white tips, turtles, grouper, jacks, bumphead parrotfish
              and of course the barracuda that give it its name. For those who
              want to be surrounded by some of the most fascinating ocean life
              the world has to offer, Barracuda Point just off Sipadan Island is
              certainly one of the best places to go.

            <p>
              An upwelling means this splendid wall sectione is favoured by
              pelagics. Expect to see sharks, barracuda, eagle rays, Napoleon
              wrasse, snappers, jacks...if you can tear your eyes away from the
              fish the wall hosts thick coral with morays, nudibranchs and
              mantis shrimps being just a few of the attractions. Once hooked in
              look up and view the main attraction out over the reef wall, you
              will see the different shark species and snappers gliding by in
              the current. Eventually, unhook and glide over the reef spotting
              sleeping sharks and beautiful coral formations.

            <header>Australia, The Yongala</header>
            <p>
              The Yongala is a shipwreck off the coast of Queensland. Full of
              marine life you may see manta rays, sea snakes, octopuses,
              turtles, bull sharks, tiger sharks, clouds of fish and spectacular
              coral. The Yongala sank during a cyclone in 1911 killing 122
              people, a racehorse called Moonshine and a red Lincolnshire bull.
              In 1981 the Yongala was given official protection under the
              Historic Shipwrecks Act. The ship is 90 km southeast of
              Townsville, 10 km away form Cape Bowling Green. 109 meters long,
              the bow points north and the ship lists to starboard.
